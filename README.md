# Comparative Application of Deep Learning Models with COVID-19 CT Scans

## Description

This project aims to compare different deep learning models for the classification and analysis of COVID-19 CT scans. The models used in this project include InceptionV3, VGG, Xception, and ResNet50. The objective is to evaluate and compare their performance in detecting COVID-19 from CT scan images.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Models:** Includes InceptionV3, VGG, Xception, and ResNet50 architectures.
- **CT Scan Dataset:** Uses COVID-19 CT scan images for model training and evaluation.
- **Performance Comparison:** Compares the performance of different models on the same dataset.
